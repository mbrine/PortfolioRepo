# Kar
A racing game that I made as my final project submission in Nanyang Polytechnic. 

## Installation
1. Download `Kar.zip`.
2. Run `Kar.exe`.

## Gameplay
- Arcade handling, drift to take corners tighter
- The game features a car builder, which allows for basic manipulation of wheels and other aspects of the car
- Basic car customization
- Attempted machine learning implementation, unfortunately unsuccessful at the time due to inexperience.

## Controls
### Mouse/Keyboard
> *Racing*
> - W - Accelerate
> - S - Brake
> - A/D - Turn
> - LShift - Toggle drifting (Hybrid car type only)


## Notes
- Several of the vehicles used in Kar were provided by my friends and classmates, all of which are listed below:
> A Bike In Time
> A Car In Time
> ChariKart (Charizard Kart)
> Drahgoon
> JetSpray
> PattyWagon
> RaonLauncher
> Saber
> Speedboat
- Customization for these vehicles (if applicable) was done by separating parts of the original mesh and using them as custom parts.
- The credits are removed due to containing personal information. Clicking the button will show a blank screen instead.
