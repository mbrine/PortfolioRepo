# My Design Intent
A PDF file containing my thought process when designing levels for video games.

# Past Levels
> # One Million Quest
> A large-scale level featuring several key interactions, with portions of the map opening as the story progresses in order to prevent players being overwhelmed.
> Details regarding the project can be found at OneMillionQuest.pdf, with the various images showing different expected routes in the level.

> # MegamanMaker
> Three levels created in Megaman Maker made at Easy, Medium and Hard difficulty.
> Playthrough videos are included below for viewing convenience:
> - [Snow Cabin (Easy)](https://youtu.be/XzufOhB88yg)
> - [Ruined Switches (Medium)](https://youtu.be/sCutjdRqebQ)
> - [Laser Gauntlet (Hard)](https://youtu.be/h4LAY0DsRXo)
> 
> Each folder contains the levels' cadence charts and .mmlv files.
