# Rocket Kar
A personal racing game project I programmed between July 2021 and September 2022. During this time, I was in National Service and not allowed to use a computer during the week. As such, much of the code was written while using my phone to remotely control my home computer while I was in camp.

The project was abandoned when I got a laptop to use in camp, which unfortunately was not powerful enough to run Unity. As such, I pivoted to smaller-scale projects afterward.

## Installation
1. Download `Rocket Kar.zip`.
2. Run `Rocket Kar.exe`.

## Gameplay
- Drifting-based driving with unique handling for every vehicle.
- Most vehicles have an "Exotic" variant, which significantly alters its statistics and driving model.
- Basic garage scene for interacting with owned vehicles.
- AI Racers that can react to their car's handling characteristics (Currently only available on some tracks)
- Car customization

## Notes
- The default save file provided contains one of every Exotic car variant in the game, along with some normal cars set to Exotic rarity.
- Garage scene may sometimes fail to load, in which case it may need to be restarted to fully load.
- The debug menu in the garage scene contains several shortcuts for controlling the game using just a mouse. This was because I could not easily manipulate the camera and move the character using my phone remote control, and had to make some workarounds.
- The AI driver names are references to my friends on Twitch.
